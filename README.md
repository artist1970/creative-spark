# creative-spark
An interactive, offline-ready art and idea generator created for Archaemenes Academy. Students begin by defining creative inputs — theme, mood, symbols, and style — then generate poetic project prompts and abstract color-canvas art, all in the browser. Built in vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript. Designed for classroom use, accessible offline.
